=========================================================

This sample demonstrate how to highlight barcodes using Datawedge API.

It will displays colored overlays on barcodes/qrcodes/... that contains the value entered in the edit text under the Red, Green, Blue fields in the GUI.

The priority of the rules detection is Red over Green over Blue.

The rules are "contains" wich means that an overlay of a specific color will be displayed if it finds a barcode/qrcode/datamatrix/... that "contains" the string that the user entered in the main view of the application under the color's name.

After changing a value, the user has to push the button "Highlight Imager/Camera" to update the rules in DataWedge.

The user can revert to regular scanning anytime by hitting the button "Regular Scan".
